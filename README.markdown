# ActsAsParanoid

A simple plugin which hides records instead of deleting them, being able to recover them.

This branch targets Rails 3.0.X. If you're working with another version, switch to the corresponding branch.

## Credits

This plugin was inspired by [acts_as_paranoid](http://github.com/technoweenie/acts_as_paranoid) and [acts_as_active](http://github.com/fernandoluizao/acts_as_active).

While porting it to Rails 3, I decided to apply the ideas behind those plugins to an unified solution while removing a **lot** of the complexity found in them. I eventually ended up writing a new plugin from scratch.

## Usage

You can enable ActsAsParanoid like this:

    class Paranoiac < ActiveRecord::Base
      acts_as_paranoid
    end

### Options

You can also specify the name of the column to store it's *deletion* and the type of data it holds:

-   :column => 'deleted_at'
-   :type => 'time'

The values shown are the defaults. While *column* can be anything (as long as it exists in your database), *type* is restricted to "boolean", "time" or "string".

If your column type is a "string", you can also specify which value to use when marking an object as deleted by passing `:deleted_value` (default is "deleted").

### Filtering

If a record is deleted by ActsAsParanoid, it won't be retrieved when accessing the database. So, `Paranoiac.all` will **not** include the deleted_records. if you want to access them, you have 2 choices:

    Paranoiac.only_deleted # retrieves the deleted records
    Paranoiac.with_deleted # retrieves all records, deleted or not

### Real deletion

In order to really delete a record, just use:

    paranoiac.destroy!
    Paranoiac.delete_all!(conditions)

You can also definitively delete a record by calling `destroy` or `delete_all` on it twice. If a record was already deleted (hidden by ActsAsParanoid) and you delete it again, it will be removed from the database. Take this example:

    Paranoiac.first.destroy # does NOT delete the first record, just hides it
    Paranoiac.only_deleted.destroy # deletes the first record from the database

### Recovery

Recovery is easy. Just invoke `recover` on it, like this:

    Paranoiac.only_deleted.where("name = ?", "not dead yet").first.recover

All associations marked as `:dependent => :destroy` are also recursively recovered. If you would like to disable this behavior, you can call `recover` with the `recursive` option:

    Paranoiac.only_deleted.where("name = ?", "not dead yet").first.recover(:recursive => false)

If you would like to change the default behavior for a model, you can use the `recover_dependent_associations` option

    class Paranoiac < ActiveRecord::Base
        acts_as_paranoid :recover_dependent_associations => false
    end

By default when using timestamp fields to mark deletion, dependent records will be recovered if they were deleted within 5 seconds of the object upon which they depend.  This restores the objects to the state before the recursive deletion without restoring other objects that were deleted earlier.  This window can be changed with the `dependent_recovery_window` option

    class Paranoiac < ActiveRecord::Base
        acts_as_paranoid
        has_many :paranoids, :dependent => :destroy
    end

    class Paranoid < ActiveRecord::Base
        belongs_to :paranoic

        # Paranoid objects will be recovered alongside Paranoic objects
        # if they were deleted within 1 minute of the Paranoic object
        acts_as_paranoid :dependent_recovery_window => 1.minute
    end

or in the recover statement

    Paranoiac.only_deleted.where("name = ?", "not dead yet").first.recover(:recovery_window => 30.seconds)

### Validation
ActiveRecord's built-in uniqueness validation does not account for records deleted by ActsAsParanoid. If you want to check for uniqueness among non-deleted records only, use the macro `validates_as_paranoid` in your model. Then, instead of using `validates_uniqueness_of`, use `validates_uniqueness_of_without_deleted`. This will keep deleted records from counting against the uniqueness check.

    class Paranoiac < ActiveRecord::Base
      acts_as_paranoid
      validates_as_paranoid
      validates_uniqueness_of_without_deleted :name
    end

    Paranoiac.create(:name => 'foo').destroy
    Paranoiac.new(:name => 'foo').valid? #=> true


### Status
Once you retrieve data using `with_deleted` scope you can check deletion status using `deleted?` helper:

    Paranoiac.create(:name => 'foo').destroy
    Paranoiac.with_deleted.first.deleted? #=> true

### Associations
Associations are also supported. From the simplest behaviors you'd expect to more nifty things like the ones mentioned previously or the usage of the `:with_deleted` option with `belongs_to`

```
class ParanoiacParent < ActiveRecord::Base
	has_many :children, :class_name => "ParanoiacChild"
end

class ParanoiacChild < ActiveRecord::Base
	belongs_to :parent, :class_name => "ParanoiacParent"
	belongs_to :parent_with_deleted, :class_name => "ParanoiacParent", :with_deleted => true
end

parent = ParanoiacParent.first
child = parent.children.create
parent.destroy

child.parent #=> nil
child.parent_with_deleted #=> ParanoiacParent #it works!
```

## Caveats

Watch out for these caveats:

-   You cannot use scopes named `with_deleted`, `only_deleted` and `paranoid_deleted_around_time`
-   `unscoped` will return all records, deleted or not

# Support

This gem supports the most recent versions of Rails and Ruby.

## Rails

For Rails 3.2 check the README at the [rails3.2](https://github.com/goncalossilva/rails3_acts_as_paranoid/tree/rails3.2) branch and add this to your Gemfile:

	gem "acts_as_paranoid", "~>0.4.0"

For Rails 3.1 check the README at the [rails3.1](https://github.com/goncalossilva/rails3_acts_as_paranoid/tree/rails3.1) branch and add this to your Gemfile:

	gem "rails3_acts_as_paranoid", "~>0.1.4"

For Rails 3.0 check the README at the [rails3.0](https://github.com/goncalossilva/rails3_acts_as_paranoid/tree/rails3.0) branch and add this to your Gemfile:

	gem "rails3_acts_as_paranoid", "~>0.0.9"

## Ruby

This gem is tested on Ruby 1.9, JRuby and Rubinius (both in 1.9 mode). It *might* work fine in 1.8, but it's not officially supported.
